# North American Country Route API

## Overview

Web API built using Flask and Python that allows users to find the route a driver must travel to go from the United States of America to a specified North American country. Utilizing a simplified map of North America, the API supports requests for routes based on three-letter country codes and returns the path from the United States to the given country.

## Features

- **Endpoint for Route Retrieval**: Users can send a request with a three-letter country code and receive a list of all countries that must be traversed to reach the destination from the USA.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm**: The API implements a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path through the countries.
- **Error Handling**: If an invalid country code is provided, the API returns an appropriate error message.
